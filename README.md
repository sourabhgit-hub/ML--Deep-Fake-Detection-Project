# ML - Deep-Fake-Detection-Project
Problem Statement and Background: Deepfakes can distort our perception of the truth and we need to develop a strategy to improve their detection. Deep Fakes are increasingly detrimental to privacy, social security, and democracy. We plan to achieve better accuracy in predicting real and fake videos.

We plan to use Detect fake videos using “DeepFake detection” challenge dataset of Kaggle. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data The full dataset contains 470 GB of video files(training and testing) and a metadata file for each video. We plan to use 100 videos with ground truth, split them as 70% training, and 20% test and evaluate models using this. We plan to build a model that generalizes well.
